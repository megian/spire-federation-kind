# Spire Federation using Kind Clusters
Spire Federation provides zero trust security of workloads in kubernetes clusters and is wide adopted by cloud service
providers. In this example we will create two clusters and setup them with trust domains `cluster1.com` and `cluster2.com`

Then we will use the same example provided in spire official example and modify the docker container to be suitable
for kubernetes deployment.
